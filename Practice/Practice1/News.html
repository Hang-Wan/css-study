    <p class="PassageStyle">The Australian government has released a new report that aims to secure the future of the endangered southern cassowary, but not everyone is convinced it will work.</p>
    <p class="PassageStyle">Dubbed a "living dinosaur", the southern cassowary looks akin to its prehistoric ancestors, with its dagger-like claws, deep growl and remarkable 2-metre stature.</p>
    <p class="PassageStyle">Weighing up to 75 kilograms, the bird is only found in Far North Queensland and Papua New Guinea, and fewer than 5,000 are believed to remain in Australia.</p>
    <p class="PassageStyle">A federal draft recovery plan for the bird includes input from conservation groups, councils and state authorities and addresses the cassowary's biggest killers â€” including car strikes and dog attacks.</p>
